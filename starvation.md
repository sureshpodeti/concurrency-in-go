Starvation happens when a process is deprived of necessary resources and is unable to complete its function.

Starvation can happen because of deadlocks or inefficient scheduling algorithms for processes.
Some times, some greedy concurrent processes deny resources to other processes or adequate resources simply do not exist.

Solution:
You should either have an independent entity as a resource manger or employ better resoure-allotment algorithms which make sure that every process gets its fair share of resources.
