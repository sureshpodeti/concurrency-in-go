### What is concurrency?

It's **Ability** of a program or a algorithm to break into different parts that can execute / run independently. <br>
Final result is same as that of the program that runs sequently (Produces correct output). <br>
We achieve the results in **lesser** time, thus increasing the overall performance and efficiency of our programs

Trickly with concurrent programs is to ensure the correctness of your program yourself.
