### What is concurrency?

It's **Ability** of a program or a algorithm to break into different parts that can execute / run independently. <br>
Final result is same as that of the program that runs sequently (Produces correct output). <br>
We achieve the results in **lesser** time, thus increasing the overall performance and efficiency of our programs

Trickly with concurrent programs is to ensure the correctness of your program yourself.

All the individual chunks of your program should be exectuted independently and have access to the shared memory
(i.e they can read from or write to the same memory location). 

We need to take care of allocation of resources so that no process **starves** due to lack of resources.
In addition, we have to synchronize and coordinate between processes so that you can prevent a **deadlock** if they dependent on each other.

In short, concurrency is all about designing and structuring your algorithm to solve problems efficently.
